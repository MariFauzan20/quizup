# Quizup

Quizup is intented to improve higher order thinking skills because it can encourage people to be critical in analysis of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments to form a judgement. This application is designed to train your mind and brain and develop your cognitive abilities. Quizup was created as the form of Capstone Project production (Education) at GENERASI GIGIH 2.0 with Yayasan Anak Bangsa Bisa.

The relationship between a web-based application that provides various things related to everyday student learning and critical thinking is
the creation of insight and experience related to future problems in learning activities, so that students can quickly identify
and draw appropriate conclusions on the problems encountered and improve the process of receiving precise and accurate information in their daily lives.
With this, it is hoped that the critical thinking process in students can be directed and achieved optimally.
