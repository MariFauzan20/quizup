Quizup is designed to train your mind and brain and develop your cognitive abilities. Quizup was created as the form of Capstone Project production (Education) at GENERASI GIGIH 2.0 with Yayasan Anak Bangsa Bisa.

The relationship between a web-based application that provides various things related to everyday student learning and critical thinking is
the creation of insight and experience related to future problems in learning activities, so that students can quickly identify
and draw appropriate conclusions on the problems encountered and improve the process of receiving precise and accurate information in their daily lives.
With this, it is hoped that the critical thinking process in students can be directed and achieved optimally.
